# Heron's Formula Calculator

## Overview

Heron's Formula Calculator is a web-based application designed to calculate the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known. The calculator also provides the perimeter and identifies the type of triangle based on the side lengths.

## Features

- **Calculate Area**: Computes the area using Heron's Formula.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: Displays the sum of all three sides.
- **Triangle Classification**: Identifies whether the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly form inputs and clear results display.
- **Detailed Calculation Steps**: Shows step-by-step computation using LaTeX-rendered equations.
